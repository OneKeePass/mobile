// This is the main entry point for the React Native app when we use shadow-cljs to build the JS bundle.
// When we used Krell, the index file was generated by Krell itself. 
// Krell build was used till OneKeePass Mobile v0.17.0 

// RN Metro bundler looks for index.ios.autofill.extension..js as the entry point for ios autofill extension.
