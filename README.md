**OneKeePass Mobile Application** is a open source and secure password manager. It supports the KeePass-compatible database (Kdbx 4.x). It stores and manages all your passwords and other sensitive information in a single encrypted file that can be stored in any location, including local and public cloud solutions. The app relies on iOS and Android OS provided integration with storage providers.  


All created database files are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES-256, ChaCha20).The database is locked with a master key.

You can install OneKeePass for Android from Google Play store and OneKeePass for iOS from Apple app store
